      We've announced our 2016 dates and are preparing to open up registration for competitors.  While we make every attempt to accommodate our international participants, the timing of the live events is has to align with the judges and creative team. 
      <br /><br />
      It's going to be an epic event, and we look forward to a great Virtual Design Master Season 4 in 2016 together with all of you in our #vDM Community.
