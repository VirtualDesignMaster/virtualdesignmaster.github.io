        Designs are in, and the judges put the participantes to the test at this point.  Designers have had to justify architectural decisions that have gotten them to the second phase of the competition.  This is where the competition starts to get even more tough.
        <br /><br />
        Does your design stand up to physicial difficulties?  Perhaps an all around disaster?  This is where things begin to get even more interesting as participants must illustrate how they can adapt to challenges within the original designs. 
        <br /><br />
        Who knows, what could happen at this point.  You may even find yourself building out resiliency in someone else's design.  That's what it takes to be a Virtual Design Master.
