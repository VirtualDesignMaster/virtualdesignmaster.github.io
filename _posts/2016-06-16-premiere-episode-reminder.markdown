That time is upon us as we prepare for our premiere episode of the Season 5 for the Virtual Design Master event.  This year we have another amazing field of competitors, and a number of very generous and supportive sponsors. 

Set your calendars to make sure that you are a part of the event live while it happens!  This is going to be another epic event for sure.

You can watch right here live and we will be updating the site for the live broadcast leading into each session.  Make sure to also follow along on Twitter using the #VirtualDesignMaster hashtag.

See you on the 22nd!
