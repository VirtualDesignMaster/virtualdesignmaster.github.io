Each year, Virtual Design Master looks for supporting partners who are have a strong community focus.  This year we are proud to introduce an all new sponsor to the VDM audience with our hosting provider [Packet.net][packetsite] for the 5th season of this exciting community competition.

The team at Packet.net are providing hosting for our final challenge of Virtual Design Master which you can imagine will feature some interesting designs and deployments.  We may even find a way to sprinkle some more interesting opportunities for the bare metal server goodness that [@PacketHost][packettwitter] provides to see just how interesting this year's competitors can make VDM.

Make sure to give a big thanks and a shout out to [the Packet team on Twitter][packettwitter] on behalf of us here at VDM. 

Thank you so much, Packet.net!
