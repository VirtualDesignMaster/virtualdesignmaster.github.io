Another big thank you goes out to a great community supporter.  We are happy to welcome Brian Suhr to a growing list of sponsors for Season 4 of Virtual Design Master.  

Brian is both a strong community supporter, a VCDX himself, and an author. You can visit Brian's blog at [virtualizetips.com][bsuhrwebsite] and you can also follow him on Twitter at [@bsuhr][bsuhrtwitter].

Make sure to give a shout out to [Brian on Twitter][bsuhrtwitter] on behalf of us here at vDM. Brian is presenting 8 copies of his book [Architecting EUC Solutions][bsuhrbook] to some of our lucky competitors for Season 4, and we may have a couple of those as a part of our Viewer's Choice prize.

Thank you so much, Brian!
