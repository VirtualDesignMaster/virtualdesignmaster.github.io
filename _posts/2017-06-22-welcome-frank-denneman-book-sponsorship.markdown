Each year, Virtual Design Master enjoyes the ability to show our community focus through viewer prizes and interactive opportunies throughout the event.  This year we are proud to welcome a great technologist and friend of the community, [Frank Denneman][franksite] as a book sponsor for the 5th season of this exciting community competition.

Frank has recently completed the book [vSphere 6.5 Host Resources Deep Dive][booktwitter] and is providing 10 copies to the Virtual Design Master team to be able to give out to our audience as we go through the Season 5 events.  We will be giving away books every week with some fun and interactive ways to win your copy, so make sure to watch live and be a part of the competition.

Make sure to give a big thanks and a shout out to [Frank on Twitter][franktwitter] on behalf of us here at VDM. 

Thank you so much, Frank!
