The Virtual Design Master event has one especially important part of what makes it all work.  The community judges panel that we are proud to have join us each year has continued to bring industry leaders, community contributors, and technology experts from every part fo the world.  

Season 5 of Virtual Design Master is no different!  This year we are proud to announce that we are being joined by [Rebecca Fitzhugh][rebeccatwitter], [Byron Schaller][byrontwitter], and [Lior Kamrat][liortwitter].

The fifth edition of this growing community competition will also feature some special guest judges along the way.  That will be part of the surprise as we get further into the season as it unfolds live through Summer 2017.

We want to send a huge thanks to Rebecca, Byron, and Lior for joining us and contributing their time and efforts for the upcoming event.  Each judge brings a variety of certifications as a part of their background, including all three who have recently gotten their VMware VCDX designations.

Register now before it's too late! [Registration][register]. If you have questions, you can ask let us know via [Twitter][vdmtwitter] or directly to any of the [Creative Team][creativeteam].
