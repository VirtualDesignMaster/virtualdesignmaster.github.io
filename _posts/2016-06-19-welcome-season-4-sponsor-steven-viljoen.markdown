We are very proud to announce another of our Virtual Design Master Season 4 sponsors.  Welcome to our very own Season 3 Virtual Design Master champion (aka VDM003), Steven Viljoen.  You can follow him on Twitter at [@StevenViljoen][steventwitter]

Make sure to give a little [Steven on Twitter][steventwitter] on behalf of us here at vDM. Steven is going to be presenting a very special competitor spot prize which will include a 1 year Subcription to PluralSight as well as a special prize for the competitor's family in order to recognize the support that every Virtual Design Master needs to succeed. 

Thank you so much, Jason!
