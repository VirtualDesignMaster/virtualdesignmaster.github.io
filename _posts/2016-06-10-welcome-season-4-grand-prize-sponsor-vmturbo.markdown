We are very proud to begin our Season 4 sponsorships with the grand prize sponsorship by Turbonomic!  We will be seeing the Season 4 participants being announced in two weeks during our premiere episode where we will also present the initial challenge.

Thank you to Turbonomic for donating a $1000 prize to be use towards the certification exam by the winner.  This is a very exciting opportunity for us at Virtual Design Master.  Having a great community supporter like VMTurbo among our sponsors is an important part of what we are building here with the Virtual Design Master event and community.

Make sure to give a little [shout out on Twitter][turbotwitter] on behalf of us here at VDM. You can learn about [Turbonomic][turbo] and the [Green Cirle Community][greencirclecommunity] and we will be featuing more details on VMTurbo and our other sponsors leading up to the Season 4 premiere.
