We are very proud to announce another of our Season 5 sponsorships with the grand prize sponsorship by RoundTower Technologies!  We will be seeing the Season 5 participants being announced on June 22nd during our premiere episode where we will also present the initial challenge.

Thank you to Turbonomic for donating a $1000 prize to be use towards the certification exam by the winner.  This is a very exciting opportunity for us at Virtual Design Master.  Having a great community supporter like RTT among our sponsors is an important part of what we are building here with the Virtual Design Master event and community.

Make sure to give a little [shout out on Twitter][rtttwitter] on behalf of us here at VDM. You can learn about [RoundTower Technologies][rtt] and we will be featuring more details on RoundTower and our other sponsors leading up to the Season 5 premiere.
