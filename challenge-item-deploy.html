      <h3>Deploy</h3>
      <p>
        This is the final challenge.  The participants have put themselves through incredible amounts of efforts up to this point.  Making it here is a sign that your skills and execution have helped you stand above the crowd in this very dynamic and challenging competition.
        <br>
        The Virtual Design Master finalists are ready to test themselves in the ultimate no holds barred, no way out challenge.  Deploying a live environment on real infrastructure in a timeline that would challenge the best in the business is just the start.  
        <br>
        Not only do our finalists have to put together a live, working environment and give over the keys to the judges to pore over to pick out every detail, but they have to do it and give their designs and decisions in one final defense in front of the judges.
