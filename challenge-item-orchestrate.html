      <h3>Orchestrate</h3>
      <p>
        In today's infrastructure designs, there is no room for error.  That means that orchestrating your enviroment is a must-have feature.  This could mean that we are orchestrating workloads in the environment, or perhaps even the infrastructure itself. 
        <br /><br />
        Infrastructure-as-Code is more than just a buzzword, and this is the chance for the remaining Virtual Design Master participants to strut their stuff in an orechestration challenge.  If you thought you were all ready to go with something you've already done, don't be surprised if the creators twist things up on you here.  
        <br /><br />
        The competition is tight at this point, and we are down to the final competitors.  This is the last chance to cement your place in the final competition.
